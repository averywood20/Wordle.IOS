Submitted by: Avery Wood

Wordle is an application that allows users to guess a random word from a predefined list. The users can change how many guesses they want to have, the theme of the word, or how many letters the word will be, and choose an Alien mode which means that anytime the user guesses the wrong word the target word changes. 

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Main trouble was with github and committing while making it organized for readers.
