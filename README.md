# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Avery

Wordle is an app that generates a random target word out of a predefined list, and users will guess the correct word. The user will be told which letters are incorrect and correct depending on the color change of the letter tiles. 

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total
