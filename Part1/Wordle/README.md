Created a wordle app according to assignment instructions.
# Project 2 - Wordle

Submitted by: Avery Wood

Wordle is an app that generates a random word from a predefined list and allows a user to guess that word. The user will be notified on correct letters, incorrect letters etc based on the coloring of the letters. 

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [ ] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [ ] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [ ] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


## Notes

Figuring out the syntax was a little tricky at first and determing the usage and syntax of closures was confusing.
